Tagging as v1.1.1


--------------------

Proditor:
	- Added spell icon to the cast bar.
	- Added a small lock frame button to the anchor since so many people seem to be unaware of that you can hide it.
	- Changed minimum priority to 0 when adding spells o the aura tracker.
	- Made the announcement function a bit smarter.
	- The enemy frames now has their Alpha lowered to 0.25 if the unit goes into stealth/invisibility and lowered to 0 if the unit leaves the arena.
