--==-- Inspectre Functionality Description --==--

Addon type: Interface
Libraries used: none

This addon allows you to keep inspecting a player even after they've gone out of range
or you deselect them as your target. Note that this does not allow you to open the inspect
window from any range, as that is impossible; it merely allows you to keep viewing the
contents of the window after you have already opened it and the inspectee has departed.
