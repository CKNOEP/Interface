--==-- TooltipItemQuantities2 Functionality Description --==--

Addon type: Library
Libraries used: none

This embeddable addon is a library that tracks item quantities for tooltip Set<place>Item methods, so that
other addons which require quantity information to display appropriate additional tooltip information will
not have to hook those tooltip methods themselves.


Here is the API, for developers:

TooltipItemQuantities2.RegisterTooltip(tooltip)
	Embeds an object called "TooltipItemQuantities2" into the tooltip and hooks all of its item methods to cache
	the quantity for later retrieval through the method called tooltip.TooltipItemQuantitites2:GetItemQuantity().

quantity, source = tooltip.TooltipItemQuantities2:GetItemQuantity()
	Returns the quantity and source of a tooltip's current item. This is generally called during the OnTooltipSetItem
	handler. The quantity may be 0, but will not be nil. The source is the tooltip method from which the quantity
	was obtained, such as "SetBagItem".

minor, subminor = TooltipItemQuantities2.GetVersion()
	Returns the minor and subminor components of the currently running version of the addon. This is
	the 2 and 3, respectively, of a number like 1.2.3. This is useful if you are depending on the non-embedded
	version of the library.
