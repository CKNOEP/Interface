brought to a merchant or which are in the default database, which consists of approximately 31,000
items (almost every item in the game as of 3.0.3). Type "/veva" for configuration options, including the
text, color, and visibility of the tooltip's money line prefix, and whether or not to include a separator
line between the price line and the rest of the tooltip.
