--==-- VendorValues Version History --==--

5.0.2 (Feb 3, 2009):
	Optimized:
		- Now uses a newer version of the ItemVendorPricesDB library which uses fewer resources.


5.0.1 (Dec 25, 2008):
	Fixed:
		- Refixed the bug in the default UI that caused Recipe-type items to have their vendor value
			added to the tooltip twice.


5.0.0 (Dec 16, 2008):
	New:
		- Rewritten for WotLK.


4.1.1 (Jul 22, 2008):
	- Updated embedded libraries to fix an error at load.
	
	- Fixed a conflict with a newer version of ConfigManager1 that would cause the separator to reset
		at login to being shown.


4.1.0 (Apr 19, 2008):
	- Fixed a bug where, if the tooltip was set to an item that wasn't yet cached, two lines of the tooltip
		would be improperly hidden.
	
	- Now uses ConfigManager1.
	
	- Miscellaneous code style updates.


4.0.1 (Jan 28, 2008):
	- Now uses version 1.2.0 of the TooltipItemQuantities1 library, which adds support for quantity
		information on guild bank item tooltips.


4.0.0 (Jan 19, 2008):
	- Rewritten for efficiency.
	
	- Now uses new library system.
	
	- Added :UpdateQuantity() method for clients with custom buttons with item tooltips.
	
	- Now uses the generic GetSellValue() developer-defined method to get vendor prices, instead
		of using a specific vendor price addon. Regardless, ItemDB_VendorPrices1 is still included in
		the distribution, since it participates in propagating the aforementioned function.


3.0.0 (6/24/07):
	- Rewritten to use the OnTooltipSetItem widget handler for GameTooltip objects, combined
		with the TooltipItemQuantities1 library, to improve efficiency.


2.1.0 (6/12/07):
	- Restructured all tooltip-individual data to reside within a table called VendorValues in the
		given tooltip, to avoid using so much of the tooltip object's base namespace. As a result
		of this, for example, the tooltip:VendorValues_AddVendorPrice() method is now instead
		accessed as tooltip.VendorValues:AddVendorPrice().


2.0.0 (6/7/07):
	- Rewritten to use the ItemsDB_VendorPrices library instead of maintaining its own database.
	
	- Now uses the EventsManager library to handle events.
	
	- Now uses the :GetItem() method on GameTooltip objects to obtain the link for the item being
		displayed, instead of using unique functions to do that within each individual hooked method.
		This increases efficiency and maintainability by reducing complexity.


1.4.2 (2/5/07):
	- Fixed an error that occurred when clicking on links in chat.


1.4.1 (2/1/07):
	- No longer attempts to send data messages through the guild addon channel when you are not in a guild.
	
	- Fixed a bug where the hidden parsing tooltip would occasionally erroneously not be hidden and appear
		at the top left corner of the screen.
	
	- Now forcibly hooks ChatFrame_MessageEventHandler to ensure that no data from the hidden channel
		is displayed. This is inefficient, but as of 2.0.6 it is the only way to block the channel with certainty.


1.4.0 (1/29/07):
	- Now broadcasts through the built-in guild addon data channel when broadcasting is enabled, in addition
		to the existing method of a hidden global chat channel.
	
	- Fixed a bug where the hidden global chat channel was not actually being hidden upon first login.
	
	- Updated TOC number to 20003.


1.3.0 (1/7/07):
	- Added about 2,000 more items to the static database.
	
	- Imported the new, more efficient vendor price parsing code from LootLink 7.8.3.


1.2.0 (12/28/06):
	- Fixed a bug where price data from the hidden channel could overwrite your existing data. Values from
		the channel will now only be stored if you have no value at all for the given item in your database.
		This is to prevent the proliferation of invalid values by spoofers.
	
	- As a result of the above, there is a new slash command option to accept data from specific players whom
		you have deemed trustworthy. Type "/veva trust [name]" to toggle trusting data from player [name].
	
	- Expanded the premade database from ~4,000 items to ~11,000 items, presumably thanks to "Colalight".
	
	- Fixed an error that sometimes popped up while parsing vendor prices, which occurred as a result of a
		Blizzard bug wherein tooltips do not create their needed FontString text lines until the tooltip is shown.


1.1.0 (12/26/06):
	- Changed the name of the hidden chat channel from "vendorvaluesdata" to "lootlinkdatasharing", which is
		the channel that LootLink uses now.
	
	- Imported the new, more efficient, more accurate vendor price parsing algorithm which appears in versions
		7.3.0 and later of my (Saeris's) LootLink, as well as the functionality changes from versions 7.6.0 and later,
		which are described below.
	
	- The vendor price line of the tooltip will now always be visible, and will display "<none>" for items which
		have been confirmed unsellable, or "<unknown>" for items with no known sell value.
	
	- As a corollary to the above, the Tooltips_AddVendorPrice method now returns two values: the
		monetary value which was added to the tooltip (either the amount of copper as an integer, false
		for unsellable, or nil for unknown), and the FontString object in the tooltip which contains the text
		which was just added.
	
	- Fixed a bug where the money frame of GameTooltip would remain colored non-white even after VendorValues
		was finished using it to display stored vendor price.


1.0.0 (12/12/06):
	- Initial release.
