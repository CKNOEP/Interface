--==-- ItemVendorPricesDB2 Functionality Description --==--

Addon type: Library
Libraries used:
	EventsManager2

This embeddable addon is a library which manages a database of item vendor prices (how much
money can be obtained by selling an item to a vendor), for use by other addons which require such
data. It loads a base database from the DefaultDatabase file and then stores any new or different
prices in an errata table which is saved between sessions. Also, this library implements the GetSellValue()
developer-defined API function, as described here: http://www.wowwiki.com/API_GetSellValue


Here is the API, for developers:

In the following descriptions, these terms are defined:
	itemID - A key from the database. A simple positive integer.
	data - A price value from the database.


size = ItemVendorPricesDB2.GetDBSize()
	Returns the size of the database.

data = ItemVendorPricesDB2.GetData(itemID)
	Returns the data (price) corresponding to the itemID (key) in the database.
	
oldData, newData = ItemVendorPricesDB2.SetData(itemID, newPrice)
	Sets the database's data for itemID to the newPrice. If this new data differs from that in the database
	at the time, it is stored in the errata table.


minor, subminor = ItemVendorPricesDB2.GetVersion()
	Returns the minor and subminor components of the currently running version of the addon. This is
	the 2 and 3, respectively, of a number like 1.2.3. This is useful if you are depending on the non-embedded
	version of the library.



The library registers some custom events with EventsManager2 which can be used to monitor for new
or updated data:
	ItemVendorPricesDB2_DB_SIZE_CHANGED
		Args:
			1 - The old database size, 0 the first time this fires.
			2 - The new database size.
		Triggers any time an item is added to or removed from the database. Of note is that this
		fires BEFORE the update events for price (except for the first time), so the very next one
		of those will correspond to whatever item was added or removed.
	ItemVendorPricesDB2_PRICE_CHANGED
		Args:
			1 - itemID
			2 - Old price, potentially nil.
			3 - New price, potentially nil.
		Fires when an item's price changes. The old price will be nil if the item was not in the database.
		The new price will be nil if the item is being removed from the database.


To embed the library into your addon, place the Lib-ItemVendorPricesDB2 directory into your addon's directory.
Then, add the line PATH\ItemVendorPricesDB2_Loader.xml at the top of the file list in your .toc file, such as
Lib-ItemVendorPricesDB2\ItemVendorPricesDB2_Loader.xml. Ensure that all of the required libraries load prior to this.

To run the library non-embedded, require it by listing it in the RequiredDeps line of your .toc file. Then, tell
users to ensure that they always have the latest version installed. To check the running version from your
addon, call the API function ItemVendorPricesDB2.GetVersion().

Either embedded or non-embedded, the saved variables stub should be present in order for errata and
rarity exclusions to be saved. This stub acts just like a normal load-on-demand addon. Your addon does
not need to list it at a dependency.
