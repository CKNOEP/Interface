--==-- ItemVendorPricesDB2 Version History --==--

2.2.0 (Feb 2, 2009):
	Changed:
		- Now uses the ItemPrice-1.1 library for a static database, reducing resource usage
			considerably and also adding some more prices. That library does not store errata,
			however, so that functionality is still implemented here.


2.1.0 (Jan 12, 2009):
	Changed:
		- Database format is now a string table plus a lookup cache, rather than a massive hash
			table. This reduces memory usage to 27-59% of previous (starting at 27% and moving
			up as more links are cached by request). This also reduces loading time of the default
			database significantly. This change is completely transparent to client addons.


2.0.0 (Dec 16, 2008):
	New:
		- Rewritten for simplicity and efficiency.


1.0.3 (May 4, 2008):
	- Now uses LibStub as a load manager.


1.0.2 (Apr 23, 2008):
	- Cleaned up database loading code to handle multiple static databases more elegantly.


1.0.1 (Apr 19, 2008):
	- Boosted default database from 15612 to 18213.
	
	- Miscellaneous code style updates.


1.0.0 (Jan 19, 2008):
	- Initial release.
