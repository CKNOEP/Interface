Version: 1.3.4
Author: Kurohoshi (EU-Minahonda)

--INFO
BPT's main purpose is providing a highly configurable eclipse bar with energy prediction to Balance druids. 
It's focused on using the CPU strictly necessary and no more, therefore, it's divided into several modules.
Energy track and prediction supported by LibBalancePowerTracker.
Masque, MikSBT & LibSharedMedia are supported.
