Release notes for MapNotes version 6.09.50001 Mists of Pandaria - 4 November 2012
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There were three tickets raised for v6.08 within hours of release. Once of them
involved non-persistence of MapNotes options across a reload (thanks Dridzt) and
I thought that so important that I should release a fic as soon as possible.

These are the fixes

- Some of the values set with the Options dialogue were not properly being
  restored after logging out. This was because of the design of the options
  data whereby a missing entry indicated that that entry was 'enabled'. I have
  changed MapNotes so that *all* options how have an entry that says explicitly
  whether it is enabled or disabled

- Zooming the World Map out to the World view showing the whole of Azeroth caused
  the addon to crash (thanks sykopat). This was because there is no map information
  available from either LibMapData for this map, and Astrolabe forces an exception
  if it is asked to provide it. I have made it impossible to add notes to either
  the World map or the Cosmic map (Azeroth plus Outland)

- sykopat reported a crash on trying to delete note by creator. I haven't been able
  to reproduce this, but see that it was executing code in the Yatlas addon that
  hooked a function in MapNotes code, so the problm may be there instead. I have
  made the parameter checking more robust and added some diagnostic code to this
  section

Release notes for MapNotes version 6.08.50001 Mists of Pandaria - 3 November 2012
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a major release. Many bugs have been fixed and the addon is pretty solid
once more.

The biggest change is that calculations for the notes is now event driven,
and only done when something has changed that may affect the note display. The
way it worked before I inherited the project was that calculations were all done
on every screen refresh, many times every second. This was using a lot more
processor time than was necessary and I haven't had the confidence until now that
I could change this without breaking it. No one should now have any problems with
frame rate hits from this addon.

I have also made these changes:

- Added the Astrolabe library to provide map coverage where LibMapData fails

- Added support for the new microdungeons. Notes can now be made inside 

- Prevented the AutoMapNote Landmarks from creating notes for landmarks that
  already have an icon. This is primarily the flight points and the locations
  in Wintergrasp

- Restored the save/cancel buttons on the note editor frame. This was caused by
  a change in the name of a button template in the Pandaria release of WoW. The
  same fix has also restored the `Delete Landmarks` and `Close` buttons on the
  options dialogue

- Fixed line drawing. This is now available by alt-left-click on two notes on the
  World Map, or through the right-click menu on a World Map note

- Fixed note deleteion. ctrl-shift-right-double-click now deletes notes as it should

- Correctly assigned initial values to options on a new installation. In particular
  the notes no longer start out invisible because of a zero alpha setting

- Added mouse wheel support to the slider controls of the options dialogue. Just
  hover your mouse pointer over the control and roll the mouse wheel - the setting
  will change accordingly

- Restored the functionality where a party note (ctrl-shift-rightclick on the World
  Map) is automatically sent to all other members in the party. This hasn't been
  working since WoW v4.01 which changed things so that an addon has to register 
  to say which addon messages it wants to r3eceive

- Fixed support for people who like a rotating minimap. Calculations were being
  done in a mixture of degrees and radians so notes were appearing in odd places
  on the minimap

- Restored 'Mass Delete by Creator' functionality. This previously worked if you
  used the enter key, but failed if you used the `Accept` button

- Many internal changes that have no impact on the user interface apart form
  improving the efficiency of the addon

Please let me know if you have any problems with this version, or have any thoughts
on what improvements you would like to see. I haven't yet looked properly at the 
other MapNotes modules (Browser and IconLib) and am sure there are some changes
needed there.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Updated interface level to 50001 for this version of World of Warcraft

Removed dependency on GetNumRaidMembers API call that has been removed from this 
version

Added the Ace LibMapData to better calculate the map dimensions and keep up with 
zone changes

Diagnosed excessive CPU use as multiple unnecessary calls to 
SetMapToCurrentZone. Added null stub declaration as a temporary fix

Diagnosed minimap notes not tracking properly as a confusion over whether map 
was indoors or outdoors. Forced more frequent reassessment as a temporary fix

Pandaria!

Release notes for MapNotes version 6.05.40300 - 06-Dec-2011
-----------------------------------------------------------

I've put back MapNotesForAtlas as people have asked to test it.

I've also put in the fixes provided for the Bindings.xml file by keyesc.
Thank you for that!

The old release notes apply. Please let me know as soon as possible if
there are any issues.

Release notes for MapNotes version 6.04.40300 - 05-Dec-2011
-----------------------------------------------------------

After encouragement to update this addon, I am releasing a beta so that any
major bugs can be ironed out. This release does little more than update the
interface number so that it will load without enabling 'Load out of date
AddOns'. I have also removed the MapNotesForAtlas component as I have no
evidence that anyone is using it.

As always, PLEASE back up the saved variables file before trying this version,
and stop WoW completely before you install the new version. This time you
should also delete the folder called

  World of Warcraft\Interface\AddOns\MapNotesForAtlas

If you have any issues with installation, or any bugs that remain please let me
know and I will try to fix them promptly. I have been told about very slow
startup, but have been unable to reproduce it. But bear in mind that several
addons are still not ready for the 4.3.0 release of WoW and you should test
with 'Load out of date AddOns' DISABLED for now, and ideally with MapNotes
running alone if you come across any issues.

I have a fix to make the facility to draw lines between notes work properly,
and I have done some design for a number of other improvements. But please let
me know what you want from this addon as I nearly let it drop assuming there
was no longer any interest. It will do anything and nothing, according to what
you want!

If you know of any other players who might be interested in this addon then
please encourage them to try this out and talk to me. A favourite feature is
the party note (ctrl-shift-rclick on the map) which is automatically set as a
minimap note for the entire party, and is even useful solo to show a general
direction to fly without constant reference to the world map.

This note from the previous release also applies.

See you at the Faire :)

== Map Note Information ==

- Added minimap scaling data for a couple of zones. If you can't make a note
  visible on the minimap then it is because it has no scaling information for
  that zone. Please let me know the value of

    /run print(MapNotes.MapKey)

  if this is happening to you somewhere and I will get it fixed

- Shared map note information for all phases of the same zone
